 - The “libpixelif” interface translates output from the fizmo Z-Machine to a pixel-based interface by using the freetype2 engine, providing proportional font display, antialiasing, and subpixel-rendering along with HiDPI support.
 - It uses the “Fira Sans” and “Fira Mono” font faces which were made by Erik Spiekermann and Ralph du Carrois.
