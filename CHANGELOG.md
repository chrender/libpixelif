   **Version 0.7.3**

 - Fixed missing evaluation of events on start-up. This fixes
      a bug that made the interpreter crash when your initial screen size
      was less than the default size. This fix does now also allow
      resizing the window during frontispiece display.

 - The “libpixelif” interface translates output from the fizmo Z-Machine to a pixel-based interface by using the freetype2 engine, providing proportional font display, antialiasing, and subpixel-rendering along with HiDPI support.
 - It uses the “Fira Sans” and “Fira Mono” font faces which were made by Erik Spiekermann and Ralph du Carrois.
