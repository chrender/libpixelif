   Version 0.8.4 -- August 28, 2017
 - Fix superfluous libraries and includes during install when using $DESTDIR,
   addressing github issue #21.
 - Fix possible buffer overflow when writing score and turn data into status
   line.
 - Made screen size functions use 16-bit instead of 8-bit values, allowing
   version 5+ games to work with screen dimensions > 255.
 - Add missing "clean-dev" target.

   Version 0.8.3 -- April 9, 2017
 - Adapted to replacement of en_US locale with en_GB from libfizmo.
 - Fixed missing opening screen and disappearing prompt during timed input in
   "eliza.z5". Thanks to Stephen Gutknecht for reporting the problem.
 - Fixed overlong reverse chars. This corrects several ASCII art problems as
   in Photopia, Nameless and ZChess, as well as in several opening screens.
   Thanks to Stephen Gutknecht.
 - Fixed incomplete flush function in true_type_wordwrapper.c. This corrects
   the incorrect display of the startup-screens in "AtWork.z5" and
   "Photopia". Thanks to Stephen Gutknecht for reporting the problem.
 - Raised version number into 0.8 range to comply with general version scheme
   for new modules.

   Version 0.7.3
 - Fixed missing display of upper screen output on game start, like, for
   example, the title display of "Alpha" or "Anchorhead".
 - Fixed missing evaluation of events on start-up. This fixes a bug that made
   the interpreter crash when your initial screen size was less than the
   default size. This fix does now also allow resizing the window during
   frontispiece display.
 - Fixed build error which occured when "--disable-x11" was set for drilbo.
 - Fixed drawing the scrollbar at invalid positions.

   Version 0.7.2 -- October 9, 2016
 - Improved build system for separate library and interface builds.

   Version 0.7.1 -- August 31, 2016
 - Use tiny-xml-doc-tools for documentation.

   Version 0.7.0 -- July 28, 2016
 - The "libpixelif" interface translates output from the fizmo Z-Machine to a
   pixel-based interface by using the freetype2 engine, providing
   proportional font display, antialiasing, and subpixel-rendering along with
   HiDPI support.
 - It uses the "Fira Sans" and "Fira Mono" font faces which were made by Erik
   Spiekermann and Ralph du Carrois.
